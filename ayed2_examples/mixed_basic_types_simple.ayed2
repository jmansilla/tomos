//Â Simplest example of AyED2 snippet:
var one: char
var two: int
var three: bool
var four: real

var arrow_one: pointer of char
var arrow_two: pointer of int
var arrow_three: pointer of bool
var arrow_four: pointer of real

one := 'f'
two := 10
three := true
four := 4.0

alloc(arrow_one)
*arrow_one := one
one := 'a'
alloc(arrow_two)
*arrow_two := two
*arrow_two := *arrow_two + 10
alloc(arrow_three)
alloc(arrow_four)
*arrow_three := !three
free(arrow_three)
*arrow_four := four / 3
